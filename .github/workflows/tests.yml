on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master, claude/* ]  # Run on pushes to these branches
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]  # Run on PRs targeting these branches

# Jobs to run (we'll start with just one: testing)
jobs:
  test:
    name: Run Tests

    steps:
      # Step 1: Download your code from GitHub
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Python
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      # Step 3: Install test dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

      # Step 4: Run the tests with coverage!
      - name: Run pytest with coverage
        run: |
          pytest tests/ -v --tb=short \
            --cov=rpi_usb_cloner \
            --cov-report=term-missing \
            --cov-report=xml \
            --cov-report=html

      # Step 5: Display coverage summary
      - name: Coverage Summary
        if: always()  # Run even if tests fail
        run: |
          echo "📊 Coverage Report:"

          echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
          echo ""
          echo "✅ Test workflow completed!"

      # Step 6: Upload coverage reports as artifacts
      - name: Upload coverage reports
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
