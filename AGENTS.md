# AGENTS.md - AI Assistant Guide

This repository’s primary assistant guide is in `CLAUDE.md`.
All instructions in `CLAUDE.md` apply to Codex and Claude Code unless noted below.

## Codex-specific notes

- Follow the instructions in `CLAUDE.md` for architecture, conventions, workflows,
  and safety rules.
- Keep this file lightweight to avoid duplication drift; update it only if there
  are Codex-specific requirements that differ from `CLAUDE.md`.
