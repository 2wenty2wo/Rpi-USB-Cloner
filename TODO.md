# WebUI:
- Can't control confirmation screen (noticed in Update screen confirmation screen) with WebUI controls, only via GPIO.

# Image Repo:
- Allow users to create a new Repo Drive using the menu system on device (creates the flag file on the drive).
- Why is the repo drive being shown in the select drive? repo drive should never be a drive you can "choose".
